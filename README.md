# Pan-cancer genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEMs)

This repository contains 917 genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) reconstructed by mapping gene expression
profiles from primary tumor samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas into a generic GEM for human
metabolism, HMR2.0. 

These GEMs were reconstructed as part of a study published in bioRxiv (http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/26/050187), called "Pan-cancer analysis of the metabolic reaction network".
